## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I developed a web application using vanilla JavaScript to calculate a person's age based on their birth date. Through this project, I enhanced my JavaScript skills by practicing various concepts such as working with Date objects, implementing logical calculations for age determination, and validating user input for birth dates. Additionally, I gained experience in handling edge cases such as leap years and ensuring accurate age calculations even when the birth date falls on the current day. Overall, this project served as an excellent opportunity to strengthen my JavaScript proficiency, improve my problem-solving abilities, and enhance my understanding of programming logic.
